This is a simple single-page movie blog written in rails/backbone.js, with responsive styling via Twitter bootstrap.

While a lot of this code is reusable -- and people are free to pick it apart for useful bits as they please -- as a whole it is very tailored to a very specific purpose that I'm unsure anyone else will find use for. It is in no way a general-purpose blog; every post is meant to be about a movie in a more-or-less predefined set of movies that I curated for myself. Yeah, seriously.
