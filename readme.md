This is a simple single-page movie blog written in rails and backbone.js (with some fancy responsive styling via bootstrap and LESS).

This is in no way a general-purpose blog; every post is meant to be about a movie in a more-or-less predefined set of movies that I curated for myself. Yeah, seriously. You can find more info about the blog's concept on the blog itself.

## development ##

The front end is mostly done, at least functionally. Some of it could be better organized, purely in terms of where things like templates live.

I'm now working to set up the database and the means by which to add posts. This is Rails, though, so it will almost build itself.
