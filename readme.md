This is a simple single-page movie blog written in rails/backbone.js, with responsive styling via Twitter bootstrap.

This is in no way a general-purpose blog; every post is meant to be about a movie in a more-or-less predefined set of movies that I curated for myself. Yeah, seriously. You can find more info on the blog itself.
